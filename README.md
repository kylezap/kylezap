## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Kyle, a developer with a varied professional journey in client facing roles at firms selling content management systems, online video, accounting software platforms and subsequently the residential real estate industry. I love learning, solving complex problems, and building relationships.

I'm particularly interested in building apps that help consumers make smart choices about their real estate needs. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: @house-compass, an app built with React and Google Maps Javascript API that helps users find the direction a home faces.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning : Python

- Fun Fact: I rode my motorcycle 3,000 miles across America!
